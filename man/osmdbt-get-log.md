# NAME

osmdbt-get-log - Write changes from replication slot to log file


# SYNOPSIS

**osmdbt-get-log** \[*OPTIONS*\]


# DESCRIPTION

Get recent changes from the database and writes them into a log file in an
internal format which can be read by `osmdbt-create-diff`.


# OPTIONS

\--catchup
:   After reading the changes and committing them to disk, mark them as done.

-s, \--real-state
:   Report the real state of the database (the LSN and xid) instead of just
    "0/0 0".

-m, \--max-changes=NUM
:   Maximum number of changes that will be read. The actual number might be
    larger than this, because changes are always read up to the commit.
    Default: no maximum.
