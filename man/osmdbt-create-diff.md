# NAME

osmdbt-create-diff - Read replication log and create OSM change file from it


# SYNOPSIS

**osmdbt-create-diff** \[*OPTIONS*\]


# DESCRIPTION

Read log files created by **osmdbt-get-log** and create an OSM change file
in XML format.

Reads all files specified with **-f, \--log-file** or all log files in
the `log_dir`. Sorts all objects in the files by type, id, and version and
writes them out as gzipped OSM change file (`.osc.gz`). It also creates an
updated state.txt file.

Data in the log file will always be ordered by object type, id, and version
before the diff is written out so the input order in the log(s) file does not
matter.

The sequence of actions in detail:

1. Create `RUN_DIR/osmdbt-create-diff.pid`. If the file already exists,
   end with an error.
2. Read state from `CHANGES_DIR/state.txt` or use the sequence number from
   the **-s, \--sequence`** option.
3. Read all log files specified using **-f, \--log-file** or found in the log
   directory. Only files with suffix `.log` are read.
4. Create a change file `TMP_DIR/new-changes.osc.gz` and a new state file
   `TMP_DIR/new-state.txt`. A copy of the state file is stored with the
   name `TMP_DIR/new-state.txt.copy`. All files are synced.
5. If the option **-n, --dry-run** was specified the processing is now done.
6. Create directory hierarchy under `CHANGES_DIR` as needed and move, in that
   order, the change file(s) and the state file into the directory hierarchy,
   sync the directory, then move the copy of the state file into
   `CHANGES_DIR/state.txt` and sync that directory.
7. Append `.done` to all log file names used. Sync log directory.
8. Remove the pid file and end.

# OPTIONS

-f, \--log-file=FILE
:   Name of a log file to be read. The names are relative to the `log_dir`
    specified in the config file. Can be specified multiple times. If this
    option is not used, all log files (with suffix `.log`) in the log_dir
    are read.

-m, \--max-changes=NUM
:   Maximum number of changes that will be written out. The actual number
    might be larger than this, because always complete log files are read.
    Default: no maximum.
    (Changes are counted as the number of object changes plus one extra
    "change" for each database commit.)

-n, \--dry-run
:   Create updated state file and new change file in tmp directory, but do
    not move them into their final locations. The log files are also not
    renamed.

\--with-comment
:   Add comment on first line of state file with current date. This is for
    backwards compatibility with Osmosis which created this line.

-s, \--sequence-number=NUM
:   Use sequence number NUM. Do not read `state.txt`.

@MAN_COMMON_OPTIONS@

# THE CHANGE FILE

The created change file will contain all the nodes, ways, and relations
in that order. Objects are ordered by id and version. Tags in objects are
ordered by their key in "C" collation order, i.e. by the byte values of the
UTF-8 encoding.

# DIAGNOSTICS

**osmdbt-create-diff** exits with exit code

0
  ~ if everything went alright,

2
  ~ if there was an error while doing its job, or

3
  ~ if there was a problem with the command line arguments or config file
